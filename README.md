# BandNameGenerator
Created a Band Name Generator Quiz!

This was a project for 100 Days of Python with Angela Yu.

print('Welcome to the Band Name Generator App')
city = input('Where did you grow up?\n')
pet = input('What was the name of your first pet?\n')
print("You should rock out as" + ' ' + city + ' ' + pet + '!')

Started by printing a message to the user.
Next I asked for the city they grew up in using a variable with an input.
Following that up I asked the user for their pet's name. 

I then combined these two variables and added some spaces and punctuation.
